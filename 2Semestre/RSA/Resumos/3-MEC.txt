What is MEC and what is its purpose?

It aims to bring cloud computing capabilities and services closer to the network edge, enabling faster response times, reduced latency, and enhanced application performance. MEC allows the deployment of computing resources, such as servers and storage, at the edge of the network, which is typically closer to the end-users. It offers benefits such as reduced latency, improved application performance, traffic optimization, and contextual services, while accommodating the diverse network requirements of IoT solutions.

characteristics: Openness to 3rd Party Apps, Traffic Redirection, Low latency, Location Optimization, ...



Describe MEC App, MEO and MEP.

MEC App: These apps run in a virtualized environment, and normally they consume services although they can also provide functionalities or services to other apps. They have specific rules and requirements about routing, necessary resources (RAM, CPU,...) and QoS requirements (low latency, high bandwidth, or reliability). If supported these apps con be moved around, based on the type of application and mobility of the user the app can be realocated to another host. Also MEC Apps can interact and provide services to other apps within the MEC ecosystem, making it easier for collaboration and the development of more complex and integrated applications that leverage the capabilities of multiple apps.

MEP: Is an environment that facilitates the discovery, consumption, advertisement, and offering of services by Mobile Edge Apps within the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) ecosystem. It provides a set of functionalities that are necessary to run MEC applications on a specific virtualization infrastructure and enable their operation. It offers self-provided services such as persistent storage and DNS, and supports management and orchestration of MEC applications.

MEO: It is responsible for maintaining an venal view of the MEC system such an available resources, available MEC services and topology. It is also responsible for the on-boarding process for apps entering the MEC environment. It verifies the app's rules, requirements, and operator policies to ensure compliance. It controlls the entire lifecycle of apps within the MEC system. It handles app instantiation, termination, and, if supported, app relocation to different MEC hosts. This ensures efficient resource utilization and seamless app operation. The MEO optimizes resource allocation within the MEC system. It takes into account the available resources, such as processing power, memory, and storage, and assigns them to apps based on their requirements and the overall system conditions.



What are the benefits of MEC and Cloud used together?

Edge computing focuses on processing data and running applications closer to where the data is generated or where users are located. It's like having small computers or servers nearby that quickly handle tasks and provide immediate responses. This is useful for things like fast-loading web pages, real-time monitoring, or controlling devices in your home.
Cloud computing, on the other hand, involves using powerful remote servers accessed over the internet. These servers can store vast amounts of data, run complex software, and handle heavy workloads. It's like having a big data center somewhere else that can do all the heavy lifting for you.

MEC processes data closer to devices, resulting in faster response times.
The cloud provides access to unlimited computing resources, allowing scalability and flexibility.
Applications perform better with optimized processing between MEC and the cloud.
Data processing is more efficient as MEC handles local data, reducing unnecessary transfers to the cloud.
Using the cloud's pay-as-you-go model helps control costs and optimize expenses.
MEC ensures sensitive data stays local, while the cloud provides secure storage and access controls.
MEC and the cloud combined offer real-time and personalized services based on context information.

Combining MEC and cloud computing offers benefits such as reduced latency, scalability, enhanced application performance, efficient data processing and management, cost optimization, data privacy, and context-aware services. This integration allows organizations to create a powerful and flexible computing ecosystem that leverages the strengths of both edge and cloud environments, enabling a wide range of innovative applications and services.



Future of MEC:
MEC will enable the widespread of emerging technologies like Iot, 5G and IA. It will pride support for ultra-low latency and real-time data processing for applications at the network edge while also enduring who Syrenento and having faster response times and better performance. The integration of MEC with cloud computing will enable distributed and collaborative computing environments by providing a seamless connectivity across divine deview and networks
