# MECT - Autonomous Networks and Systems

## Objectives
Provide an overview of autonomous networks and systems that enable the construction of wired and wireless networks. In these networks and systems, the nodes self-organize to maintain services typically managed by a centralized control system, such as:
- Medium access
- Routing
- Quality of service
- Security
- Content distribution
- And more

By the end of this course, students should have acquired the skills to design, develop, control, and manage an autonomous network system.
