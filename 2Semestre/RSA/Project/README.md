### Scenario Summary: RSU Monitoring E-Scooters

#### Components:
- **RSU (Road Side Unit)**: Central monitoring unit installed in various locations.
- **OBUs (On-Board Units)**: E-scooters equipped with communication modules.

#### Workflow:
1. **E-Scooter Request for Parking**:
   - OBUs detect available spots or receive updates from the RSU.
   - Send parking requests to the RSU.

2. **RSU Response**:
   - Receives requests and evaluates.
   - Responds with designated parking spot location.

3. **Parking Coordination**:
   - OBUs navigate to designated spots.
   - Confirm status back to RSU.

#### Key Points:
- **Centralized Management**: RSU monitors and manages parking requests.
- **Efficiency**: OBUs quickly find parking, reducing congestion.
- **Communication**: Uses efficient protocols for dynamic environments.

#### Benefits:
- **Optimized Parking**: Efficient utilization of available spots.
- **Traffic Management**: Minimizes congestion with directed parking.
- **User Experience**: Reliable and convenient parking solutions.

### Conclusion:
The scenario showcases RSU-monitored e-scooters enhancing parking management and traffic flow, improving user mobility and convenience.
