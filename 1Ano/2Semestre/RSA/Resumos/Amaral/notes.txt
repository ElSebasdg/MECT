Problem with TCP in vehicular/ad-hoc networks:
	- Assumes all losses are due to congestion (it has loss detection and congestion control mechanisms)
	- Mobile networks have mobility, high bit error rate, unpredictability, contention, poor performance for long connections
	- Delays can cause TCP to send unnecessary retransmissions, being more inneficient

TCP Cubic:
	- Takes into account the time that has elapsed since the last congestion
	- Allows for faster recovery and greater throughput	

QUIC:
	- Built on top of UDP
	- Improve performance by reducing latency
	- Uni and bidirectional streams
	- Stream flow and connection control
	- RTT: time for data packet to be sent + receive ACK of that packet
	- Uses separate sequence numbers for data and packet delivery
	- Lower RTT indicates better network conditions and makes better management of multiple streams independently
	- Provides more accurate and responsive RTT estimations

TCP Vegas:
	- Senses congestion before any packet loss, decreasing window size
	- Uses differece between expected rate and actual rate
	- It has a modified slow start and new retransmission

ALL TCP VARIANTS: try to improve performance by estimating the available bandwidth or exploiting buffering capability (uses explicit failure notifications, TCP sender doubles retransmission timeout, avoid timmeout and unnecessary retransmissions, requires assistance from intermediate nodes)

QoS in UDP:
	
	- IntServ: hard to estimate available resources, do resource reservation (and its pinned to a route)
	- DiffServ: hard to do admission control and maintain assurances

QoS Routing: essential component for QoS, can inform source node of bandwidth, QoS avaliability, destination and path. Adds QoS requirements in routing metrics (difficult route maintenance, overhead, reserved resources not guaranteed, response to mobility)

QoS for AODV: 
	- Adds extension to route messages
	- Node that receives can only forward if it meets QoS requirements
	- Routing tables updated with new fields (delay, bandwidth)
	- Maximum delay extension (list of sources requesting delay guarantees during route discovery)
	- Bandiwdth extension (list of sources requesting bandwidth during route discovery)
	- Loosing QoS (sending of QoS_LOST messages if node detects QoS cannot be maintaned)

QoS for BATMAN:
	- Add local link quality in the TQ value
	- TQ = TQ (incomming) - TQ (local)

QoS for OLSR:
	- Multi-point relays are the nodes with best QoS
	- QoS depends on available bandiwdth, percentage of nodes on other street and lane weight

Routing attacks:
	
	- Modification: 
		. malicious nodes announce better routes to be inserted in network (changin route seq. number, hop count)
		. DOS attacks with modified routes and changes packet headers so it doesn't reach destination

	- Impersionation: 
		. Usurpation of the identification of another node to perform changes
		. MAC address spoofing, creating loops and leavin nodes unreachable

	- Fabrication:
		. Generates false traffic to disturb network
		. False route messages corrupting route state
		. Routing table overflow
		. Replay attack
		. Black hole attac (0 metric route)

Symmetric cipher:

	- fast and secure, larger keys -> larger security
	- requires the sare of secret key, complex administration

Asymetric cipher:

	- No need to shake hands, scalable and versitle
	- Computationally intensive, certificate authority, confidential private key

SOPKM (Self-organized public key management):

	- Users issue certificates based on personal acquaintance (certificates stored and distributed by themselves)
	- Has repository of updated and expired certificates
	- If a user U believes a key Kv belongs to user V, then U can issue a public-key certificate in wich Kv is bound to V signed by U
	- Certificate exchange between nodes, each node mulitcasts its certificate graphs to neighbour nodes (1-hop)	
	- Users share public keys when they meet
	- If user wants to find public key of node, it must find the cain of valid public-key certificates leading to that user
	- Certificates can be revoked explicitly or implicitly (expiration)
	- Exchange allows nodes to virtually gather all certificates, cross-checking the user-key bindings in the certificates to detect inconsistencies

SSAWN (Self-securing ad-hoc wireless networks):
	
	- Achieve high security scenario, with high access ratio and efficient communication
	- Localized trust model: an entity is trusted if any k neighbours claim so within a time period
	- Shared secrets: Use of Public Key and Shared Key. SK is used to sign certificates for all nodes and can be verified with the PK. Each node has a part of the secret. By collecting k partial certificates, combines them together to generate the full new certificate. Nodes without valid certificates are denied from network access.

Reputation approaches:

	- Explore reliability of each node (how they forward packets, level of trust, reputation information from neighbours)
	- Routing and communication through high rep nodes
	- Protect network from misbehaving nodes
	- There are friendly, selfish and malicious nodes

	- Reputation is the combination of first-hand (neighbours) and second-hand (info from neighbours) reputation, and behaviour follows probability of well-transmitted packers and deviation to detect false reports
	- Reputation of node B seen by A is the first-hand reputation plus the trust factor of second-hand reputation of B seen by C (and other nodes): Rab = Fab + @Fcb

	- In the normal operation of network, the choice of nodes to form a path, to join certificate graphs and get the key parts or key pairs uses the reputation of nodes (highest)
	- Reputation of nodes can change over time
