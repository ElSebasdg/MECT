#  MECT - Master in Computer and Telematics Engineering

## Objectives

The MECT aims to provide solid training in the fields of computer systems, informatics, and telecommunications. It seeks to train engineers capable of performing roles in planning, designing, developing, and researching computational and connectivity systems and infrastructures, both for high performance and specific applications. These areas are crucial in today's important fields such as cyber-physical systems, 5G telecommunications networks, datacenters, wireless local networks, and sensor networks, among others. These are key technological and knowledge domains in significant areas such as smart cities, mobility, the Internet of Things, Industry 5.0, and other vertical use cases based on Cloud and virtualized solutions, where flexibility, agility, sustainability, and energy efficiency are essential aspects.

Traditional computer science courses typically abstract the architectures of computational systems and communication infrastructures through a simplistic perspective that supports the execution of applications. This master's program, while not neglecting fundamental aspects of software applications and computer systems, pays special attention to the structure and performance of computing and connectivity infrastructures. This focus is particularly important to build systems with adequate performance, energy efficiency, and economic viability, which are increasingly important aspects for sustainable development.
