# Communication Architectures

## Objectives

The main goal of this course is to provide an integrated view of the architectures of large public communication networks, including aspects of network requirements, services, and users; management; multimedia communications; and virtualization and distribution of services.

By the end of this course, students should be able to understand:

- The evolution of telecommunications systems;
- The support of services and technologies in an operator environment, such as management, transport protocols, signaling, and multimedia systems;
- Current network architectures and virtualization trends.

The teaching methodology, based on current examples of operator networks, allows students to critically assess current telecommunications network architectures, and to solidify concepts through the application of theoretical knowledge to laboratory experiences and exploration work.

The theoretical presentation and evaluation enable students to grasp (and later demonstrate) fundamental architectural knowledge of current communication networks, as identified in the objectives (the development of the backbone, the increasing importance of quality of service in virtualized environments). The interactive formulation of classes will encourage students to reflect on the networks and services they use today and develop their own sensitivity to the reasons behind some of the situations they experience.

In practical classes, students need to transfer architectural concepts and technological limitations that sometimes restrict their applicability, providing greater depth to the knowledge being developed. Practical evaluation allows students to demonstrate acquired skills in the domain of key technologies driving current complex telecommunications system architectures.
