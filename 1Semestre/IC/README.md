# IC - Informação e Codificação

This course primarily provides knowledge and skills in the field of data compression. It begins by introducing/reviewing concepts of signal processing (sampling, quantization, representation in the frequency domain) and information theory, as well as the notion of redundancy (perceptual and statistical/algorithmic). Compression algorithms are then presented, along with their application to various sources (textual, audio, image, video), supplemented by a brief overview of the main standards for audio, image, and video coding. The objective of this course is also to provide a unified view of concepts that relate aspects of computer theory (Turing machines, computability) with aspects of classical information theory (entropy, source coding, data compression models), concepts of randomness and predictability, and their application to data analysis and exploration
