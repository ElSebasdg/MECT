# IC - Informação e Codificação

# Information and Coding

## Objectives

This course primarily provides knowledge and skills in the area of data compression. It starts by introducing/reviewing concepts of signal processing (sampling, quantization, representation in the frequency domain) and information theory, as well as the notion of redundancy (perceptual and statistical/algorithmic). Compression algorithms and their application to various sources (textual, audio, image, video) are then presented, complemented by a brief overview of the main standards for audio, image, and video coding. This course also aims to provide a unified view of concepts that relate aspects of computation theory (Turing machines, computability) with aspects of classical information theory (entropy, source coding, data compression models), concepts of randomness and predictability, and their application to data analysis and exploration.
